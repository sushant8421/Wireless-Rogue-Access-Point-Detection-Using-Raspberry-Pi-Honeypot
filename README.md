# Wireless-Rogue-Access-Point-Detection-Using-Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot


In the modern world as the internet is growing at a large scale there is a great chance of breaching of information by any unauthenticated user. Secrecy of the information is the primary concern of todayâ€™s
network system. Wireless network system are more vulnerable than the wired networks. RAP can be easily set up in the wireless network by any unauthorized user, in this paper we will demonstrate how cost effectively and easily we can detect the RAP using the Raspberry Pi Honeypot , honeypot captures the activity of the attacker and helps in improving the security of the network.
